# Explainable AI in Skin Cancer Detection: Comparing CNNs, ViT, and SWIN Transformers

## Introduction
Artificial Intelligence (AI) has revolutionized the field of computer vision, enabling breakthroughs in areas like medical imaging, autonomous vehicles, and more. However, as AI models become more complex, understanding how they make decisions has become increasingly challenging. This is where **AI explainability** comes in—a critical area of research that aims to make AI models more transparent and interpretable.

In this blog post, we explore the explainability of three prominent deep learning architectures **CNNs (YOLOv8)**, **Vision Transformers (ViT)**, and **SWIN Transformers**—in the context of skin cancer detection. Using explainability techniques like **LIME** and **GRAD-CAM**, we compare how well these models can justify their predictions. Whether you're a researcher, developer, or simply curious about AI, this post will provide insights into the trade-offs between model performance and interpretability.

## Background

### What is AI Explainability?
AI explainability refers to the ability of an AI model to provide clear, understandable reasons for its predictions. In certain applications with
In fields like healthcare, explainability is essential for fostering trust among doctors and medical professionals. By providing clear and interpretable insights into how AI models make decisions, explainability helps clinicians understand and validate the reasoning behind predictions. This trust is critical for the successful integration of AI into clinical workflows.

Moreover, AI models have the potential to uncover subtle patterns in medical data that may not be immediately visible to even the most experienced doctors. In the example that we use, in skin cancer detection, AI could identify previously unseen features in dermatological images that correlate with specific conditions. Explainability techniques like LIME and GRAD-CAM allow doctors to visualize these patterns, possibly even bringing to light features that were previously ignored. This would both allow to improve diagnostic accuracy and aid doctors in making more informed decisions.

### The Role of Computer Vision in Medical Imaging
In medical imaging, computer vision models are used to detect diseases, classify conditions, and assist in diagnosis. Skin cancer detection, in particular, has seen significant advancements thanks to deep learning models that can analyze dermatological images with high accuracy.

### Models Compared
In this project, we compare three popular deep learning architectures:

1. **CNNs (YOLOv8)**:
   - Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) are the backbone of modern computer vision. YOLOv8, an object detection model, is known for its speed and accuracy. However, its complex architecture can make it difficult to interpret.

2. **Vision Transformers (ViT)**:
   - Vision Transformers (ViT) adapt the transformer architecture, originally designed for natural language processing, to computer vision tasks. ViTs have shown impressive performance but are often considered "black boxes" due to their self-attention mechanisms.

3. **SWIN Transformers**:
   - SWIN (Shifted Window) Transformers are a hierarchical variant of ViTs that improve efficiency and scalability. They combine the strengths of CNNs and transformers but raise similar explainability challenges.

### Explainability Techniques
To evaluate these models, we use two popular explainability techniques:
- **LIME (Local Interpretable Model-agnostic Explanations)**: LIME explains individual predictions by approximating the model locally with an interpretable surrogate model.
- **GRAD-CAM (Gradient-weighted Class Activation Mapping)**: GRAD-CAM generates heatmaps that highlight the regions of an image most influential to the model's decision.
